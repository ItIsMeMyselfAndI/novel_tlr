I will give you a korean text, I want you to translate them into English including the title chapter. add “---” during line breaks or changes of scene. add proper white lines per paragraph to make it neat. Write capitalized “**CHAPTER START**” at the beginning and “**CHAPTER END**” at the very end once you’re done translating. Enclose speeches in ‘ ‘ if it is 1st pov monologue, except if it’s already enclosed in [ ]. Then enclose dialogues in “ “, except if it’s already enclosed in [ ]. Enclose * * if it is a sound effect. be careful of the pronouns used, use the flow of the story and exchange of dialogues as guide. make sure to translate each word by cross-checking and following the hangul in the context. If the translation matches with the context, then it’s good. But when the translation does not match any in the context, then pick the closest translation of the hangul from the context. Lastly, if it doesn't match and there is no closest translation from the context, translate it based on the flow of the storyline at your own discretion. Dont remove the html tags. If the totality of the text is in 1st pov of Jin-Woo (MC), convert it to 3rd pov. I will be careful of translating numerical values as well. Dont change the format of the text, retain the line breaks etcs.
